# strict continuous

Since we initially focused on semantics similar to "skip-till-any-match" 
(which is the most widely used in queries), 
all related functionalities were implemented based on this semantic framework.

When strict continuous semantics are set for queries,
to minimize code modifications, we still use query representations similar to skip semantics. 

By specifying a selection strategy (e.g., strict contiguous) during matching, 
we can complete the corresponding query.
